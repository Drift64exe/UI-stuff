    <title>Browser Fingerprinting Techniques</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Here's why you should be concerned about browser fingerprinting...</h3>
    <p>Browser fingerprinting is a tracking technique used by websites to collect data about you without needing cookies. This data can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your web browser and its version</li>
        <li>HTTP headers</li>
        <li>Installed plugins and extensions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, what are the different types of fingerprinting methods?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Canvas Fingerprinting
This method uses HTML5 canvas elements to draw images in your browser. Since different devices and browsers render images slightly differently, this process can generate a unique ID that identifies your device. </p></li>
        <li><p>WebGL Fingerprinting
WebGL exposes details about your deviceâ€™s graphics hardware and screen resolution. Because graphics drivers vary across systems, this data can be used to uniquely track a user.</p></li>
        <li><p>Audio Fingerprinting
This technique measures how your device processes audio signals. Each device has subtle differences in how it generates sound waves, which creates a unique audio profile that can be used for tracking.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why is browser fingerprinting used?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>One of the main reasons is targeted advertising. Companies use this method to track users across websites without relying on cookies. When combined with data such as geolocation, IP address, and online behaviour, fingerprinting becomes a powerful tool for profiling and monetisation.</p></li>
    </ul>
